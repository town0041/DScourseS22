%	\begin{abstract}
%This document provides a \LaTeX \ template for \emph{IISE Transactions}. Your paper should be compiled in the following order: title; abstract; keywords; main text, including an introduction and a conclusion or summary; acknowledgments; declaration of interest statement; references; appendices (as appropriate). Figures and tables should be inserted into the text as close to first mention as possible (NOT appended to the end of the manuscript). In-text citations and the reference list must follow \emph{IISE Transactions} guidelines. Use 11 point font, 1 inch margins, and double-spacing for the manuscript. A typical paper for this journal should be no more than 30 pages in manuscript format, counting from the title page to references. Appendices should be included as supplemental online materials. Do not use footnotes. \emph{IISE Transactions} uses a double-blind review process. Please make sure that you submit the \textbf{blind version} of your manuscript, which does not contain any information identifying the authors.  This includes removing the authors information on the title page as well as the information that may be identifying in the Acknowledgment section. We thank you for your attention to these details.

\section{Problem 7}

The dimension of my train data for $housing_train$ is 404 x 14 (404 observations and 14 variables). We have 59 more X variables because we must deduct the two Y outcome columns. The dimension of the new data is 404 x 73.

\section{Problem 8}

The optimal lambda is 0.00139. The in-sample RMSE in my data seems to be 0.170. The out-sample RMSE is 0.0632.

\section{Problem 9}
The optimal lambda is 0.0373. The outsample RMSE is 0.173.

I honestly tried on questions 8 and 9 but I know I'm not hitting the mark.

\section{Problem 10}

No, you would not be able to estimate a simple linear regression model on a data set that had more columns than rows. I would say that this model has a high bias-variance trade off based on its trends.
