%	\begin{abstract}
%This document provides a \LaTeX \ template for \emph{IISE Transactions}. Your paper should be compiled in the following order: title; abstract; keywords; main text, including an introduction and a conclusion or summary; acknowledgments; declaration of interest statement; references; appendices (as appropriate). Figures and tables should be inserted into the text as close to first mention as possible (NOT appended to the end of the manuscript). In-text citations and the reference list must follow \emph{IISE Transactions} guidelines. Use 11 point font, 1 inch margins, and double-spacing for the manuscript. A typical paper for this journal should be no more than 30 pages in manuscript format, counting from the title page to references. Appendices should be included as supplemental online materials. Do not use footnotes. \emph{IISE Transactions} uses a double-blind review process. Please make sure that you submit the \textbf{blind version} of your manuscript, which does not contain any information identifying the authors.  This includes removing the authors information on the title page as well as the information that may be identifying in the Acknowledgment section. We thank you for your attention to these details.

\section{Problem 9}

The table we want from R is on page 2. Our $\hat{\beta}$ estimates are very close to the $\beta$ that we used to create the data in (1). The values are almost all just barely different and would round up or down to the values we initially used to create the data.
