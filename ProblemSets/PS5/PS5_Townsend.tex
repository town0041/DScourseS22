\section{Problem 3}

My data set in this question contains information regarding notable people the US has deported. The data predominantly consists of people who committed crimes. Many observations include war criminals. I am not confident that I will use this exact information in my research, but I see several possibilities for applying similar types of data and using similar coding methods for my research! I only used Rstudio and your class instruction to collect and read the data from wikipedia.

\section{Problem 4}

For question 4 I ran code for yahoo finance that has an API. With yahoo finance, I received a substantial amount of data on stocks. This data would be extremely useful if I ever choose to do research on stock prices and trade volume. I had to install the ''pdfetch" package to run this data. Perhaps I may not use it for research, but there is a strong change I would use this for my own personal use of the stock market.
