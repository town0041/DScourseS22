I would like to scrape any data sources that involve Latin America's crime rates. I would also like to scrape tweet hashtags about Hispanic deportation rates from the United States. If there was a way for me to scrape homicide locations in Mexico from online news articles I would do that. I am very new to the idea of scraping, but it is undeniably important and I'm hoping to find a way to incorporate it into future work.
